		There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
		
		Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
		
		Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 * @example
 * 		Given n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
		Return true
		
		Given n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
		Return false
